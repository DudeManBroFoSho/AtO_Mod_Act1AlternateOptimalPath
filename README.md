# Alternate Act 1 Optimal Path

This is an Across the Obelisk mod for Adventure Mode that contains:

* A new “optimal” route through Act 1 that offers equivalent power progression to the traditional Betty -> Hatch -> Yogger route.
* The alternative “optimal” route begins at the “The Fishing Contest” event which spawns at the southern path lake node in Senenthia. That event can now start a quest for…
* A new subzone! Which contains…
* New subzone art
  * 9 new enemies with custom skins and 171 new monster cards (to represent all difficulty levels)
  * 3 rotating minibosses (12 new enemies in total!) in the new subzone, each with custom skins and abilities.
  * 3 new items
  * 2 new boons
* 28 new custom events with 61 unique replies
* Content balanced around M16 - if it feels too hard at lower madness, please provide feedback!
